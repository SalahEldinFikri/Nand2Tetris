# Nand2Tetris: Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: The-HACK-General-Purpose-Computer
### Welcome to the Nand2Tetris repository! Here you'll find my solutions for all projects from Part 1 of the Nand2Tetris course.

## About Nand2Tetris:
### Nand2Tetris offers a one-of-a-kind educational journey, guiding you from constructing a simple NAND gate to creating and programming a fully functional computer system. Part 1 of the course emphasizes the hardware abstraction layer, providing a solid foundation in digital logic and computer architecture.
